    Performs the backward algorithm for a hidden markov model:

    Observation is a numpy.ndarray of shape (T,) that contains the index of
    the observation
        T is the number of observations
    Emission is a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, M) containing the emission
    probability of a specific observation given a hidden state
        Emission[i, j] is the probability of observing j given the hidden
        state i
        N is the number of hidden states
        M is the number of all possible observations
    Transition is a 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (N, N) containing the transition
    probabilities
        Transition[i, j] is the probability of transitioning from the hidden
        state i to j
    Initial a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, 1) containing the probability of
    starting in a particular hidden state

        Pis the likelihood of the observations given the model
        B is a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, T) containing the backward path
        probabilities
            B[i, j] is the probability of generating the future observations
