# 0x0E. Time Series Forecasting


 0. When to Invest mandatory

Bitcoin (BTC) became a trending topic after its price peaked in 2018. Many have sought to predict its value in order to accrue wealth. Letâ€™s attempt to use our knowledge of RNNs to attempt just that.

Given the coinbase and bitstamp datasets, write a script, forecast_btc.py, that creates, trains, and validates a keras model for the forecasting of BTC:

    Your model should use the past 24 hours of BTC data to predict the value of BTC at the close of the following hour (approximately how long the average transaction takes):
    The datasets are formatted such that every row represents a 60 second time window containing:
        The start time of the time window in Unix time
        The open price in USD at the start of the time window
        The high price in USD within the time window
        The low price in USD within the time window
        The close price in USD at end of the time window
        The amount of BTC transacted in the time window
        The amount of Currency (USD) transacted in the time window
        The volume-weighted average price in USD for the time window
    Your model should use an RNN architecture of your choosing
    Your model should use mean-squared error (MSE) as its cost function
    You should use a tf.data.Dataset to feed data to your model

Because the dataset is raw, you will need to create a script, preprocess_data.py to preprocess this data. Here are some things to consider:

    Are all of the data points useful?
    Are all of the data features useful?
    Should you rescale the data?
    Is the current time window relevant?
    How should you save this preprocessed data?


 1. Everyone wants to know mandatory

Everyone wants to know how to make money with BTC! Write a blog post explaining your process in completing the task above:

    An introduction to Time Series Forecasting
    An explanation of your preprocessing method and why you chose it
    An explanation of how you set up your tf.data.Dataset for your model inputs
    An explanation of the model architecture that you used
    A results section containing the model performance and corresponding graphs
    A conclusion of your experience, your thoughts on forecasting BTC, and a link to your github with the relevant code

Your posts should have examples and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on LinkedIn.

When done, please add all URLs below (blog post, shared link, etc.)

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.
